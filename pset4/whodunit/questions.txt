1.  stdomt.h is the header for fixed width integer types. In this case it's being used to hold exact width types
3.  1, 4, 4, 2
2.  They are the exact size of byte, dword, long, word respectively
4.  BM
5.  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file(in bytes) and biSize is the number the structure requires
6.  If biHeight is negative it means the image is top-down. It is also not compressable 
7.  biBitCount
8.  fopen might return NULL if the input or output file do not exist or cannot be written to
9.  The third argument in fread is the number of times it will read the file. 
    Since we know the size of the BMP, it is only necessary to read it once
10. It will return 3. This is becuase we have 3 pixels at 3 bytes each and the next multiple of 4 is 12, so 3*3 + 3 = 12
11. fseek allows us to change the location of the file pointer, or where we start reading from in a file.
12. SEEK_CUR is used to offset the points from the current location
